Car Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the selling price of cars based on various features such as kilometers driven, present price, fuel type, and ownership history. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about multiple cars, including the following features:

Kilometers driven
Present price
Fuel type
Ownership history
Selling price (target variable)

Model Selection
We experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including:

Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting
Linear Regression
Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared score on a validation set.

Conclusion
This project successfully developed and deployed predictive models that can estimate the selling price of cars with reasonable accuracy. However, continuous monitoring and updating of the models may be required to ensure their performance remains optimal as new data becomes available.
