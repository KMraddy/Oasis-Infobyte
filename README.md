Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects
Overview:

This README provides a brief overview of the two projects completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte:

1. Iris Flower Classification
2. Car Price Prediction
   
Iris Flower Classification Summary
Objective: 

Classify iris flowers into three species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica) based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Techniques Used: Implemented various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

Evaluation Metrics: The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine their performance.

Car Price Prediction Summary Objective:

Predict car prices based on features such as make, model, year, engine size, and mileage.

Techniques Used: Applied regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.

Evaluation Metrics: The models were assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score to evaluate their accuracy and performance.


Conclusion:

These projects provided practical experience with machine learning techniques, focusing on data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. They enhanced my understanding of both classification and regression algorithms.
